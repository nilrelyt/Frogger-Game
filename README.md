# Group47_Frogger
This is the github repository for CS 2340 Group 47's Frogger project to be implemented with Android Studio.


Sprint 2 

    - Make the player able to move up, down, left, and right. It may be a good idea to simplify things 
    by using a grid or tile system to represent all possible locations of the player. 
        o The player should not be able to move off the screen. 
		
    - Generate safe tiles, road tiles, and river tiles. Rivers and roads should extend across the width of 
    the screen.
        o Roads and rivers should be of varying widths. For example, the player may have to cross 
        a 2-tile river or a 5-tile river, assuming a tile system is used. 
        o Water tile functionality will be implemented in a future sprint. 
		
    - Implement a goal tile 
        o Should be located at the opposite end of the map with respect to the player. 
        o The functionality associated with the goal tile (for example, going to the win screen) will 
        be implemented in a future sprint. For now, simply have the goal tile display.
